# Reproducing Schmidt et al. (2022)

In this repository, we manage several workflows, scripts, and notebooks to re-construct the project of [Schmidt _el al._ (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35113687/). A phenotypic CRISPRa screening result is integrated with scRNA-seq data. Here is one of the input artifacts:

And here is the lineage of the final result:
