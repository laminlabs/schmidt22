# Re-constructing Schmidt et al. (2022)

This use-case re-constructs a result of the research project of [Schmidt _el al._ (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35113687/) via several scripts & notebooks.

A genome-wide phenotypic CRISPRa screen was used to find transcriptional cell states that correlate with causal drivers of proteomic IFNG expression.
