# Reproducing Schmidt et al. (2022)

In this repository, we manage several workflows, scripts, and notebooks to re-construct the project of [Schmidt _el al._ (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35113687/).

A genome-wide phenotypic CRISPRa screening result was used to find transcriptional cell states that correlated with high proteomic IFNG expression.

You can explore it [here](https://lamin.ai/laminlabs/lamindata/artifact/W1AiST5wLrbNEyVq0001) together with code and data artifacts.

You can also see all code here on GitHub in `build.yml`:
